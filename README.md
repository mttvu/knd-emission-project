# Running the Emission project

- Create a repository in GraphDB named "Emission"
- Import the emissions_final.ttl file into the repository
- Make sure the provinces.geojson file is in the same folder as the GROUP38_FINAL.ipynb file
- Run the notebook

- For one of our groupmembers, the Plotly visualizations did not properly display in JupyterLab on MacOS. It did however work in Visual Studio Code for MacOS. For Windows it worked fine in both JupyterLab and Visual Studio Code.
